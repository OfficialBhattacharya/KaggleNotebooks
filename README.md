# Kaggle Notebooks Collection (2025)

This repository contains a collection of Kaggle notebooks from 2025 focused on data analysis and machine learning projects.

## Projects

### US Home Price Index (HPI) Regression Analysis
Located in the `Regression_HPI` directory, this project focuses on analyzing and predicting US home prices using historical home price index data.

The main script (`usaBaseline.py`) performs:
- Data cleaning and validation
- Missing value detection and handling
- Time series integrity checks (ensuring no missing months)
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Advanced time series analysis

### Calorie Prediction Model
Located in the `Regression_CaloriePrediction` directory, this project develops a machine learning model to predict calorie content in food items based on various nutritional features.

### Audio Spectrogram Analysis
The `Audio_MELSpec2025` directory contains notebooks for audio signal processing and analysis using Mel-frequency spectrograms, focusing on audio feature extraction and classification tasks.

### Correlation Analysis
In the `Regression_Correlation` directory, you'll find notebooks that explore relationships and correlations between different variables in various datasets, with a focus on statistical analysis and visualization.

### ARC Challenge Solutions
The `ARC_DevilsAdvocate` directory contains solutions and approaches for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge, focusing on pattern recognition and problem-solving tasks.

### Modelling Notebooks
The `ModellingNotebooks` directory serves as a collection of various machine learning models and implementations, including different algorithms and techniques for various prediction tasks.

## Usage

These notebooks are designed to run in the Kaggle environment with access to the corresponding datasets. Each project directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions and requirements.
